Commands
=================

All commands to the bot are text commands. Commands can be sent in a text channel of a Discord Guild that the bot is a member of. Select commands can be sent directly to the bot (most commands except for the ones that actually play audio). All commands have the following basic syntax:
```
commandName!arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argN
```
The `commandName` is the name of the command that will be called and everything after the `!` are the arguments of that specific command. Here are some common example commands:
```
p!chump
pr!all
list!all
list!mostplayed
upload! (with .mp3 file attached)
setgreeting!foryourhealth
```

### Category Commands

The bot supports categories, which allows the user to group audio clips into categories and then play a random clip from that category with the `pr!` command. It is also possible to list all of the clips in a certain category with the `list!` command. Categories can be created with the `newcategory!` command and clips can be added to a category with the `addtocat!` command. See the table below for more details and a full list of category commands.

Code Architecture
=================

Below you can find a diagram depicting the architecture of kev-bot. Note the main resources being leveraged by this project are: Node, Discord.js, the Discord API, Heroku, MySQL, GitHub, and Google Cloud.

![architecture](/docs/architecture.png)

### Node, Discord.js, Discord API
The javascript code that runs on node is the brains of the bot. The Discord.js library is used to interact with the Discord API.

### Heroku
Heroku is a cloud computing platform that allows you to host processes. The javascript code as well as the MySQL Database are both hosted on Heroku. Note that GitHub is connected to Heroku so that anytime the master branch is pushed to it will update the code on the Heroku server.
### MySQL
The MySQL database stores a variety of permanent data that makes features like *categories* or *greetings* possible. See below for a visual representation of the database.

![tables](/docs/sql_tables.png)

### Google Cloud Storage
A Google Cloud Storage bucket is used to store all the mp3 files. The bot downloads all of the files on startup of a new build.

Release Notes
=================

### v1.0.0
- GitHub is now public and a README has been written. Arbitrarily calling this release v1.0.0, now that everything is setup.
- Added farewells. Farewells are the same as greetings, except the clip is played on exit of a discord guild instead of entry.
- Added new categories: `playhistory` and `uploadhistory`.
- Various bug fixes and code improvements.
